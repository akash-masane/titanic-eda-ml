Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning classification on the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.
# Titanic Survival Prediction (EDA & Machine Learning)

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and basic Machine Learning
to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

The objective is to understand the data, preprocess it properly, and build a
classification model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

---

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values and clean the data
- Encode categorical features
- Build and evaluate a machine learning classification model

---

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked missing values and data types
- Handled missing values using statistical methods
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

---

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

---

## Tools & Libraries
